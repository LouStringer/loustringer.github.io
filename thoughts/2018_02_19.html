          Hiya, I’m Lou, full stack JavaScript developer in the
          making. And now blogger too, it seems. Lucky world.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I’m still levelling up to become a kick-ass JavaScript
         developer, I’m an associate lecturer at the University of York. I develop
         study skills modules for international students, coordinate teams of tutors,
         and do the odd bit of teaching. I’ve also worked in universities in Japan
         and Vietnam; similar roles, but much better food (imho, Vietnamese food
         > Japanese food. Please don't tell my friends in Japan).
        </p>
        <p>
          I was also a speech science researcher for a couple of years at UCL,
          where I did an MPhil investigating how people understand variation in accents.
          I didn’t make any ground-breaking discoveries, but I did discover coding.
          Or rather, I was tossed into the deep, murky sea of coding without a
          lifeguard present. After a pretty steep learning curve with R, MATLAB
          and a bit of a dabbling with Python, some tears, a couple of
          light bulb moments and a lot of pretty ggplot2 graphs, I was hooked.
          The magic of being able to turn just a few lines on a text editor into
          something useful, beautiful, or fun (hopefully all three!) is addictive,
          and being able to create tools that solve problems and save tons of
          time makes me feel like a wizard. An efficient, nerdy wizard.
        </p>
        <p>
          So why am I now working towards becoming a full stack JS developer instead
          of pursuing my love of ggplot2's oh so shiny graphs? A difference of
          priorities now that I'm no longer an academic researcher.
          <br />
          <a href=http://thedataist.com/the-difference-between-software-development-and-data-science/"
          target=_blank">The Dataist</a> puts it nicely:
          <blockquote cite=http://thedataist.com/the-difference-between-software-development-and-data-science/"
          target=_blank">
            Data scientists write code as a means to an end,
            whereas ... developers write code to build things.
          </blockquote>
          After what I've learned since my time as a researcher, I much prefer using
          code to build things rather than code being an analytical tool. Also,
          I've found JavaScript to be much more accessible than R. Win win.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, why bother writing about becoming a kick-ass JavaScript developer, seeing
          as there’s so many learn to code blogs already? Mostly selfish on this one
          - writing about my experiences will help me reflect on and consolidate
          what I’m learning. I can track my progress, and future me can giggle at past
          me’s coding efforts. It’s not all selfish though - maybe sharing my experiences
          can help some other people out. Saying that, I expect that mum will probably be
          my main reader (hi mum!).
