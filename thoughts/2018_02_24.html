      <h1>Hello world!</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hiya, I’m Lou. Self-Proclaimed full stack JavaScript developer in the
          making. And now blogger too, it seems.
        </p>
        <p>While I’m still working on levelling up to become a kick-ass JavaScript
           developer, I’m a study skills lecturer for international students at the University
           of York. I develop modules, coordinate teams of tutors, and do the odd bit of
           teaching. I’ve worked in universities in Japan and Vietnam too - similar roles,
           but better food.
        </p>
        <p>I also worked in speech, hearing and phonetic science research for a
           couple of years at UCL, where I did an MPhil investigating how people understand
            variation in accents. I didn’t make any ground-breaking discoveries,
            but I did discover coding. Or rather, I was tossed into the deepens of
            coding without a lifeguard present. After a pretty steep learning curve
            with R, MATLAB and a dabble into Python, with some tears and a couple of
            light bulb moments, I was hooked. The power!!!
        </p>
        <p>So why a full stack developer, and not a data scientist? Becoming a kick-ass
          data scientist was my first instinct when I decided that I wanted code for a
          living. But then I read lots of articles (such as
          <a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/what-types-of-developer-are-there" target=_blank>
            this one by The Dataist
          </a>
          and
          <a href = "http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/what-types-of-developer-are-there" target=_blank>
            this one from Treehouse
          </a>
          ), and saw that web development is a better fit for me.
          I love coding all day to build things that people can use, rather than spending
          most of my time on research and then using code being a tool to analyse my data.
          Also, the R documentation is pretty impenetrable without a CS degree, whereas
          JavaScript is much more accessible, so I can spend more time coding instead of
          translating. Win win.
        </p>
        <p> Why bother writing about becoming a kick-ass JavaScript developer, seeing
           as there’s so many learn to code blogs already? Mostly selfish on this one
           - writing about my experiences will help me reflect on and consolidate
           what I’m learning. I can track my progress, and future me can giggle at past
           me’s coding efforts. It’s not all selfish though - maybe sharing my experiences
           can help some other people out. Saying that, I expect that mum will probably be
           my main reader (hi mum!).
